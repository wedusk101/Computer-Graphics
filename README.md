Basic Computer Graphics programs using the Borland Graphics Interface for a course 
I'm taking at my university.I have been using Visual Studio 2017.
So please watch out for windows specific functions that I might have used.

1> Extract the bgi.zip file and place the source code in the extracted directory.

2> Open the solution file in Visual Studio and retarget the solution according to
your platform.

3> Compile and run :-)

Cheers!
