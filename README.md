#CPP

Hello!

This is a basic set of Computer Graphics programs (some WIP) using the Borland Graphics Interface for a course 
I'm taking at my university.I have been using Visual Studio 2017.
So please watch out for windows specific functions that I might have used.

1>	Extract the bgi.zip file and place the source code in the extracted directory.

2>	Open the solution file in Visual Studio and retarget the solution according to
	your platform.

3>	Make sure you have only one source file with a main function.

4>	Compile and run :-)

Cheers!
